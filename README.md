Eco-Efficient Deployment of Spiking Neural Networks on Low-Cost Edge Hardware

This work presents a practical and energy-aware framework for deploying Spiking Neural Networks on low-cost hardware for edge computing. We detail a reproducible pipeline that integrates neuromorphic processing with secure remote access and distributed intelligence. Using Raspberry Pi and the BrainChip Akida PCIe accelerator, we demonstrate a lightweight deployment process including model training, quantization, and conversion. Our experiments validate the eco-efficiency and networking potential of neuromorphic AI systems, providing key insights for sustainable distributed intelligence. This letter offers a blueprint for scalable and secure neuromorphic deployments across edge networks.

## 1. Hardware and Software Setup
The proposed deployment platform integrates two key hardware components: the RPI5 and the Akida board. Together, they enable a power-efficient, cost-effective N-S suitable for real-world edge AI applications.

## 2. Enabling Secure Remote Access and Distributed Neuromorphic Edge Networks
The deployment of low-power N-H in networked environments requires reliable, secure, and lightweight communication frameworks. Our system enables full remote operability of the RPI5 and Akida board via SSH, complemented by protocol layers (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), WebSockets, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)) that support real-time, event-driven intelligence across edge networks.

## 3. Training and Running Spiking Neural Networks
The training pipeline begins with building an ANN using TensorFlow 2.x, which will later be mapped to a spike-compatible format for neuromorphic inference. Because Akida board runs models using low-bitwidth integer arithmetic (4â€“8 bits), it is critical to align the training phase with these constraints to avoid significant post-training performance degradation.

## 4. Use case validation: Networked neuromorphic AI for distributed intelligence
### 4.1  Use Case: If multiple RPI5 nodes or remote clients need to receive the classification results in real-time, MQTT can be used to broadcast inference outputs
### 4.2 Use Case: If the Akida accelerator is deployed in an autonomous driving system, V2X communication allows other vehicles or infrastructure to receive AI alerts based on neuromorphic-based vision
### 4.3 Use Case: If multiple RPI5-Akida nodes are deployed for federated learning, updates to neuromorphic models must be synchronized between devices
