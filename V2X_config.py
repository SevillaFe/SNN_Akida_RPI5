## Use Case: If the Akida accelerator is deployed in an autonomous driving system, V2X communication allows other vehicles or infrastructure to receive AI alerts based on neuromorphic-based vision.

### V2X_code_akida

import socket

# ---- Configuration ----

# Define V2X communication settings
V2X_IP = "255.255.255.255"  # Broadcast to all nearby V2X-enabled devices
V2X_PORT = 5005  # Standard port for V2X UDP communication
